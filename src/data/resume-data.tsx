  summary: (
    <>
      Iâ€™m an accomplished software engineer who makes machine learning work in production. At Bosch, I built tools and infrastructure that empower teams to train, deploy, and monitor models efficiently - bridging research ideas and real-world products. My work focuses on clean architecture, automation, and performance optimization to help ML deliver consistent value at scale.
